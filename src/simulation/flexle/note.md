# Flexle has moved!

The `Flexle` module has been moved to a [separate pacakage](https://github.com/connormurphy798/Flexle.jl) and
registered with the general registry. It is now included as a dependency in `jOpqua/Project.toml`.

To eliminate confusion, all `Flexle` source code has been removed from this repository. `examples.jl` has
been left in place, as it was used to generate graphs which were used in a presentation about `jOpqua` given
by Pablo CÃ¡rdenas R.
